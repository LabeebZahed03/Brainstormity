#	Agent (role)	Core responsibility	Typical loop & tools	Why a separate agent?
0	Planner / Orchestrator	Decompose the user’s vague prompt → tasks, route outputs, schedule retries.	Hierarchical-planner prompt → DAG of sub-tasks. Stores intermediate JSON in a shared vector / KV store.	Keeps chain-of-thought local to each domain agent while preventing cross-talk hell.
1	Clarifier / Idea-Interpreter	Ask clarifying Qs, frame Problem ⟶ Proposed Solution doc.	CoT (no external tools) → prompts user if data gaps.	Gives every downstream agent a clean, structured starting point.
2	UVP Critic	Extract & stress-test the idea’s Unique Value Proposition.	CoT reasoning ➜ ReAct to compare with vector DB of existing UVPs	Isolates differentiation logic so you can swap in more advanced similarity search later.
3	Market Researcher	Pull market-size, trend, and demand signals.	ReAct + search API, news API, stat scraping → summarizer	Heavy external-data I/O = natural fit for a tool-using agent.
4	Competitor Scanner	Identify closest competitors; build feature & price matrix.	ReAct + SERP/API queries + scraping utils	Lets you parallelize wide competitor crawls while Market Researcher focuses on top-down data.
5	Persona & PM-Fit Analyst	Define Target Audience personas and evaluate product/market fit gaps.	Hybrid: uses outputs of (2) & (3) in CoT; optional survey-generator tool	Bridges “who” (persona) with “how well idea solves it” (fit).
6	Feasibility & Cost Estimator	Model MVP scope, ballpark dev costs, highlight regulatory or IP liabilities.	CoT for reasoning; calls: simple cost calc tool, legal knowledge-base search	Ensures viability dimension (can we build it?) is explicit, not buried in business model text.
7	Business-Model Synthesizer	Draft revenue streams, pricing hypotheses, key resources / partners.	CoT only (consumes outputs 2–6)	Keeps financial logic separate from raw research-gathering agents.
8	Devil’s Advocate / Risk Auditor	Attack assumptions across all previous drafts; surface SWOT & “unknown-unknowns”.	CoT; re-prompts if finds glaring hole; may spawn micro-checks (hallucination guards)	Provides the negative lens without polluting each domain agent with critique logic.
9	Action-Plan Composer	Convert everything into Actionable Next Steps ranked by impact / effort.	CoT summarizer; optionally calls Gantt-chart generator tool	Gives the user a concrete roadmap instead of a data dump.
10	Quality-Gate / Evaluator	Consistency checks, deduplication, citation coverage, style pass.	CoT; automatic regression tests on JSON schema	Final guardrail before content hits the user.
